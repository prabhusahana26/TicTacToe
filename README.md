# TicTacToe
This Tic-Tac-Toe game allows two players to take turns marking a 3x3 grid with 'X' and 'O'. The game checks for a winner after each move, displaying a message when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw. A restart button resets the game to start a new round. The game alternates turns between players, ensuring that no moves can be made after the game concludes.
